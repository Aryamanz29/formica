## Formica
A discord form bot that lets you create forms and visualize the data via a web interface 

**Why**
Several communities have joined Discord, with over 6.7 million servers existing on discord, the need for proper form analytics has increased, while most communities use `Google forms` or other third party forms to analyze and visualize data, I believe that we can leverage Discord API to allow users to fill forms without leaving discord while also providing useful analytics to the Admin who created the form. This helps admins and mods to view the data via the discord bot or web interface, whichever is convenient 

**Ethical Data**
Collection of form data is often not taken seriously, you are providing information to be collected by one organisation but you have no idea where all the data is going to be circulated, There needs to be transparency in regards to sharing of form data to the user. Formica allows sharing of collected form data among communities also notifying users and letting them know that the data submitted on a form is being shared to another community, So the user can chose to delete his data from the shared form data. 

**Tech Stack**

JavaScript - React(or Angular)  -- Frontend 
Database - MySQL or Postgress( in combination with MongoDB or not )
